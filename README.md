## Description
Players throw a dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the dice providing the dice doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined. The first player to accumulate 50 or more points wins the game.
